# test-repo
The basic test application secured using Apache Shiro.

## What changed?
Test users, user roles, role-permission-mapping and login were configured using solely ini-configuration.
Also, implemented a custom component by extending one of Shiro's existing classes. Purpose of the custom component was to enable an OR-check for multiple user roles.
